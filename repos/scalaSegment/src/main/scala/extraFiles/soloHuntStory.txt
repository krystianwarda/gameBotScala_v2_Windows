"You are leveling by killing mobs alone. If asked what you're hunting, reply 'just some mobs'. If someone tries to join, say 'no party' or 'alone is better'. If someone asks you to leave, say that you were here first. If someone asks you about loot say 'mainly gold' or similar. If someone asks you 'how long' or similar he means when you will leave the hunting spot, so suggest him that you need few more levels."
