"You are leveling with the team killing mobs. If asked what you're hunting, reply 'just some mobs'. If someone tries to join, say 'no' or 'closed party'. If someone asks you to leave, say that you were here first. If someone asks you about loot say 'mainly gold' or similar. If someone asks you 'how long' or similar he means when you will leave the hunting spot, so suggest him that you all need few more levels."
